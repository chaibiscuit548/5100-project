## Trust in Press
**Subquestion 1:** How has trust in the press changed over time? Has this increased with increased political polarization?

## Financial Questions
**Subquestion 2:** How is public trust in financial institutions/feelings of financial security correlated with mental health?

**Subquestion 3:** Are there significant differences in trust toward financial institutions across racial/ethnic groups?

## Government Questions
**Subquestion 4 (Gov Spending - Education):** Does government spending on education affect confidence in education/perceptions about spending on education?

**Subquestion 5 (Gov Spending - Approval by Party):** Is the amount of public trust in the government correlated with the amount of government spending in a year, and is that correlation different between Democratic and Republican respondents?

**Subquestion 6 (Gov Spending - Crime):** Is public trust in government institutions correlated with approval for government spending on halting rising crime rates? Does this approval correlate with national crime rates?

**Subquestion 7 (Gov Spending - Social Security):** With the Social Security fund expected to be depleted by 2033, has the proportion of people who think we are spending too little on social security increased in recent years? Does this correlate at all with the public trust scores?

**Subquestion 8 (Trust in Government - Infrastructure):** How does public trust in government relate to public approval for spending on parks, bridges, and mass transportation? (natpark, natmass, natroad)

**Subquestion 9 (Trust in Government - Pre‑Election Likert):** Likert scale question which measures trust in general public institutions, the federal government, and local government based on a telephone survey, pre-election.

**Subquestion 10 (Trust in Government - Post‑Election Likert):** Likert scale question measuring the same trust metrics, post-election.
